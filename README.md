<div style="text-align: justify">
As a home baker and bread lover, I'd like to improve the taste of my bread. Since the microbial communities in a sourdough starter are what influences the bread's flavors, I want to try and culture sourdough starters that are associated with my preferred flavors. The factors that I can adjust are: temperature, containers, flour type etc. Studies have already established that the flour is the biggest influence on the types of microbes in a sourdough starter<sup>1-3</sup>.

Other than flour, the study by Landis et al<sup>3</sup> showed that other factors do have some minor effects on the microbes. So using Landis et al's data, I want to:

1. identify the microbes associated with the flavor profiles that I want
2. find the factors that encourage the growth of these microbes
3. Try it out and see if I get delicious bread

Even if it doesn't work out, this is a fun little personal project and experiment, so why not?
