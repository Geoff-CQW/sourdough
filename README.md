As a home baker and bread lover, I'd like to improve the taste of my bread. Since the microbial communities in a sourdough starter are what influences the bread's flavors, I want to try and culture microbes that are associated with my preferred flavors, using factors that I can play around with in my kitchen, such as temperature, containers, water, flour type etc. Some studies have already established that the flour is the biggest influence on the types of microbes in a sourdough starter<sup>1-3</sup> and I'm aiming to find other factors <em>on top of</em> flour that can encourage the desired microbes to flourish in the starter using my analysis.

Using the data from Landis et al<sup>3</sup> and I'm intending to:

1. identify the microbes associated with the flavor profiles that I want
2. find the factors that encourage the growth of these microbes
3. Try it out and see if I get delicious bread

**Very comprehensive study on sourdough starters from many countries, I encourage you to read their paper if you are interested in the interplay of the environment, microbes, starter and dough.*
